    <h3>DESCRIPTION:</h3>
    <p>Wagyu beef is a Japanese beef cattle breed that is known for its high marbling, which gives it a rich, buttery flavor and tender texture. Wagyu beef is typically more expensive than other types of beef, but it is considered to be a delicacy by many people. The high marbling of Wagyu beef is due to a number of factors, including the breed of cattle, the diet of the cattle, and the way the cattle are raised. Wagyu beef is typically graded on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest grade. Wagyu beef that is graded 5 is considered to be the highest quality and is the most expensive.</p>
