	<p>Unseasoned chicken is a bland, tasteless piece of meat. It has a slightly rubbery texture and a mild chicken flavor. It is often described as being "dry" and "flavorless."         Unseasoned chicken can be cooked in a variety of ways, but it is often cooked in a pan or on the grill. It can also be baked or poached.
